  "description": "Who's up to get up and get out meet some new people and just enjoy the day. Weather says it is going to be nice out before the rain starts so I thought it would be fun to shoot a few hoops. I am not great at basketball but I do like to shoot the ball occasionally. We can play a quick (or not so quick if everyone is like me) game of horse, around the world or other simple games that involve shooting the basketball in the hoop.",
